// Write a Bubble Sort algorithm in JavaScript.
// Note : Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to
// be sorted,
// Sample Data: [6,4,0, 3,-2,1]
// Expected Output : [-2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6]

// SOLUTION

let array = [6, 4, 0, 3, -2, 1];
console.log(array.sort());
